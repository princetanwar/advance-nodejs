## Reactor Pattern

The Reactor Pattern is a design pattern used in event-driven programming, where the handling of events (such as I/O operations) is managed by a central component called the reactor. Node.js is built on this pattern, and it utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Here's an overview of the key concepts related to the Reactor Pattern in Node.js:

1. Event Loop:

- Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations. The event loop is the core of the reactor pattern. It continuously checks for events and executes the associated callbacks
- The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.

2. EventEmitter:

- Node.js provides the EventEmitter class, which is a key component in implementing the Reactor Pattern.
- Objects that emit events in Node.js are instances of the EventEmitter class.
- You can create your own EventEmitter instances or use built-in classes that extend EventEmitter, such as the HTTP server or file system modules.

3. Listeners and Callbacks:

- Events are associated with listeners, and when an event occurs, the associated callbacks (listeners) are executed.
- In the Reactor Pattern, you define callback functions to handle events asynchronously.

4. Non-blocking I/O:

- Node.js is designed to be non-blocking, meaning that it can efficiently handle a large number of simultaneous connections without waiting for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.
- This is achieved through the use of callbacks and asynchronous functions.

5. Example:

- Here's a simple example using the HTTP module in Node.js:

```diff

+ const http = require('http');

+ // Create an HTTP server
+ const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
+   // Handle incoming requests
+   res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
+   res.end('Hello, World!\n');
+ });

+ // Listen on port 3000
+ server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
+   console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
+ });

```

In this example, the server is an EventEmitter, and the callback function is executed when a request event occurs.

6. Callbacks and Error Handling:

- When working with callbacks in Node.js, it's important to handle errors appropriately, often by passing an error object as the first parameter to the callback.

```diff
+ fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
+   if (err) {
+     console.error(`Error reading file: ${err.message}`);
+     return;
+   }
+   console.log(`File content: ${data}`);
+ });
```

Understanding and mastering the Reactor Pattern in Node.js involves becoming comfortable with working asynchronously, handling events, and leveraging the event loop for efficient non-blocking I/O.
